# GCP GCS Bucket Pulumi Module

## Overview

The **GCP GCS Bucket Pulumi Module** is engineered to streamline the deployment and management of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Storage Buckets within a multi-cloud infrastructure. Leveraging Planton Cloud's unified API framework, this module models each API resource using a Kubernetes-like structure with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. The `GcsBucket` resource encapsulates the necessary specifications for provisioning GCS Buckets, enabling developers to manage their storage infrastructure as code with ease and consistency. By defining parameters such as project ID, region, and access configurations within a single YAML file, developers can ensure that their storage resources are reproducible and maintainable across different environments.

By utilizing this Pulumi module, developers can automate the creation and configuration of GCS Buckets based on defined specifications, ensuring secure and authenticated interactions with GCP services through integrated credential management. The module supports configurable options such as enabling public access, which adjusts bucket access controls accordingly to meet organizational security requirements. Additionally, the outputs generated from the deployment, including bucket IDs and access configurations, are captured in the resource's `status.stackOutputs`. This facilitates effective monitoring and management of GCS Buckets directly through the `GcsBucket` resource, enhancing operational efficiency and infrastructure visibility. Whether deploying simple storage solutions or complex, multi-region storage architectures, the GCP GCS Bucket Pulumi Module provides the flexibility and automation needed to manage cloud storage seamlessly.
